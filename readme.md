# Legal Textual Entailment Recognition

Legal Textual Entailment Recognition is a project focused on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify entailment relationships in legal texts. This repository provides code, data processing scripts, and model implementations for automating the task of recognizing whether one legal sentence or paragraph logically follows from another.

## Overview

Legal entailment recognition is a challenging NLP task with applications in legal document review, contract analysis, and legal research. This project aims to build models that can automatically determine if a hypothesis can be inferred from a premise within the legal domain.

## Features

- Preprocessing of legal text datasets
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- Support for popular deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Tools for analyzing and visualizing entailment results

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HieuTrungCao/Legal_Textual_Entailment_Recognition.git
cd Legal_Textual_Entailment_Recognition
# Install dependencies (edit as necessary)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset**  
   Place your legal text entailment dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. **Train the model**  
   ```
   python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model**  
   ```
   python evaluate.py --model-path checkpoints/best_model.pth
   ```

Check the documentation or script headers for more details on parameters and options.

## Dataset

This project supports custom and standard legal entailment datasets. Please refer to the `data/README.md` for details on supported formats and sources.

## Model Architecture

Models implemented in this repository may include:
- Transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)
- Custom neural networks for textual entailment

See the `models/` directory for code and details.

## Results

You can find experimental results and benchmarks in the `results/` directory.
